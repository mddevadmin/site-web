<h2>ARTICLE 1 : Data controller - recipients of the data</h2>

<p>Only certain employees and/or authorized MOODDY subcontractors process Members' personal data for the purposes described in article 1.2 below. These employees and authorised managers have access only to the data they need in the course of their duties.</p>

<p>MOODDY may also contract with authenticated and reliable subcontractors who may access, host and/or process certain personal data of Members on behalf of MOODDY, according to its instructions, in compliance with the Privacy Policy and who guarantee the security and confidentiality of Members' personal data.</p>

<p>These subcontractors allow MOODDY to establish statistics on the volumes of use and/or the use of the Application and/or ensure the proper operation of the Application.</p>

<h2>ARTICLE 2 : Purposes of the processing operations carried out by MOODDY</h2>

<p>The data collected by MOODDY are necessary for the proper functioning and improvement of the Application Services offered to Members.</p>

<p>The data collected also enables MOODDY to carry out statistical studies and marketing analyses related to the use of the Application and Services by Members.</p>

<p>MOODDY may finally access Members' personal data, store them and share them with authorized third parties in response to a legal request (search warrant, court order or other) or to comply with legal, regulatory, judicial or administrative obligations; detect or prevent fraudulent activities or breaches of the security of the Services, in application and in compliance with the law.</p>

<h2>ARTICLE 3 : Fair collection of personal data - type of data</h2>

<p>Data relating to identity: The registration form is mandatory to access the Services and is collected by MOODDY from Facebook and Google to minimize formalism, via Facebook Connect and Google Connect. Registration requires the Member to communicate some of his personal data:</p>

<p>Photos: At a minimum, the public Facebook profile photo or the one associated with Google Account. The Member will then have the possibility to remove this photo and/or add other photos from his smartphone to his Account.</p>

<p>These photos must not depict a celebrity, include a portrait of a minor (unless authorized by the minor's legal representative(s)), incarnate a racist, offensive, illegal or sexual message, or contain personal information.</p>

<p>They are published in the Application under the sole responsibility of the Member.</p>

<p>By becoming a Member, the latter accepts the publication of its information in the Application.</p>

<p>The other personal data that the Member may provide in his Account are optional and communicated at his sole discretion.</p>

<p>Position (geolocation) data: The main interest and vocation of the Application is to allow Members to listen to the music of other Members around them and to interact.</p>

<p>The Member can disable the geolocation option on his smartphone. In this case the Member can no longer see which other Members are around him.</p>

<p>Data relating to communications exchanged: Messages are sent and stored on MOODDY servers exclusively to ensure the transmission of exchanges between Members.</p>

<p>Messages are strictly private and bind only interested Members. MOODDY's authorized officials do not exercise any right of control over these conversations, except upon judicial request and/or in accordance with applicable legislative or regulatory provisions and/or in the context of any evidence provided to MOODDY by a Member in connection with a report.</p>

<p>Moreover, strictly private Messages will not be accessible neither to other Members not concerned by the exchange, nor to any third parties.</p>

<p>Mobile Data: When the Member uses the Application, MOODDY collects Logs that may include information such as IP addresses, operating system or application crashes. MOODDY is not able to access the browsing history of its Members.</p>

<h2>ARTICLE 4: Additional details on the data collected</h2>

<p>The personal data that the Member has published in the Application are made strictly invisible by MOODDY to non-registered Internet users and third parties. MOODDY cannot be held responsible for data published on MOODDY and disclosed by a Member.</p>

<h2>ARTICLE 5: Warning to Members on sensitive data</h2>

<p>MOODDY does not encourage the Member to communicate sensitive data to other Members or to MOODDY via the Application. If, despite everything, the Member wishes to communicate such data on his profile, this communication constitutes express consent of the Member to the collection and processing of such data by MOODDY.</p>

<h2>ARTICLE 6 : No transfer of your personal data</h2>

<p>Personal data, visible or not for other Members, are not transferred by MOODDY to third parties.</p>
