<p>The User undertakes to inform the Publisher of any unlawful use of the Application and/or any misuse of its content of which he has become aware.</p>

<h2>ARTICLE 1 : ACCEPTATION AND MODIFICATION OF THIS C.G.U</h2>

<p>To use the Application, which can only be downloaded via the Apple Store, the User must first and simply accept the T.G.U when creating his user account, which he declares he has read and understood in full. Failing this, the User undertakes to renounce the use of the Application.</p>

<p>The Publisher reserves the right to modify the T.G.U at any time and without notice in order to adapt them to technological developments, the offer of services or applicable legislation.</p>

<p>The User may consult the latest version of the T.G.U on the website www.mooddy-app.com or on the Application.</p>

<p>In the event of non-compliance by the User with these T.G.U, the Publisher reserves the right to suspend or terminate his account without prejudice to any damages.</p>

<p>The use of the Application implements applications and hypertext links to third-party sites and/or applications published by a company other than MOODDY. The User is informed that MOODDY has no legal relationship with these third party publishers/companies which have their own general conditions of use and/or sale and privacy policy that the User undertakes to read, accept and respect. Consequently, MOODDY cannot assume any responsibility for the content and services provided from these third-party sites and applications. The User acknowledges sole responsibility for access to and use of these third-party sites and applications.</p>

<h2>ARTICLE 2 : GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF APPLICATION SERVICES</h2>

<p>The Application, which can only be used in a strictly personal and non-commercial, not-for-profit direct or indirect, aims to create a social music network based on the geolocation of Users, the sharing of music listened and networking through a chat service.</p>

<p>To be able to fully use the Application's functionalities, the User must first and expressly accept to be geolocalized by activating this parameter from his User account, it being however recalled that the Application will never display the exact location with another User but simply, for security reasons, an approximate distance.</p>

<p>The User can refuse to be geolocalized but some features will be disabled.</p>

<p>The User is also informed that the Application will broadcast advertising messages generated by third companies and over which the Publisher has no control, which it expressly accepts.</p>

<h2>ARTICLE 3 : DOWNLOAD AND FIRST USE OF THE APPLICATION</h2>

<p>Before downloading the Application, the User must ensure that he has an Internet connection (via WiFi or cellular network) and that the Application is compatible with the operating system of his mobile terminal. Connection and telecommunication costs remain the exclusive responsibility of the User.</p>

<p>The Application is downloadable from the App Store after creating an account and agreeing to comply with the App Store's own terms and conditions of use. Otherwise, the download of the Application will not be possible.</p>

<p>The Application is downloadable on Apple® iPhone® mobile devices with at least the iOS 9 operating system.</p>

<p>The User can identify himself in the Application from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Either from his Facebook account: in this case, the User will be redirected to the Facebook.com site from which he will have to enter his Facebook login credentials and authorize the Application to access the public information of his Facebook account (in particular Name, First name, Profile photo) ;</li>

<li>Email address: in this case, the User must enter his email address and a password of his choice.</li>

<li>Either from his Gmail account: in this case, the User must enter his Gmail address and the associated password.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the first opening of the Application, the User will be invited by a notification to authorize or not:</p>

<ul>
<li>Access to files of any kind from his mobile.</li>

<li>Receive push notifications (message sent by the Application even when it is closed) and e-mail alerts.</li>

<li>To be geolocalized: the geolocalization allows the User to benefit from all the functionalities of the Application described in article 4 of the present G.U.C. If the User agrees to activate geolocation, the Application will indicate to him the distance, voluntarily approximate for security reasons, which separates him from the other Users of the Application. If the User does not activate it, he will not be able to access the services and features offered on the page "User Search / Around me", as described in article 4 hereof. Only the User may, under his sole and entire responsibility, decide whether or not to communicate to another User by private messaging or chat room, his exact location.</li>

<li>Synchronization of different music libraries and all mobile sound content (video, multimedia, etc.). Indeed, the Application is integrated with applications and websites and services offered by third companies (Youtube, Deezer and Spotify) with which the User will have his own user account.  By accepting synchronization, the User may, from the Application, access his local music library as well as the music libraries he has created on other applications and websites published by third parties. Similarly, the User must allow access to all content on his mobile. Failing this, he may not use the Application.</li>
</ul>
At the first opening of the Application, the User will also be invited to set up his User Account from the page called "Profile" by indicating his name, first name, biography, profile and background photo and other social networks to which he is subscribed.</p>

<p>These settings can be changed at any time from the user account of the User.</p>
